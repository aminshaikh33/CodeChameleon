Devices designed for rhythm management are primarily used to treat arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms, which are prevalent among the aging population. Implantable devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and the more advanced leadless pacemakers have revolutionized the treatment of arrhythmias. These devices work by monitoring heart activity and delivering electrical pulses to regulate abnormal heart rhythms, thereby ensuring that the heart beats at a normal pace. The growth of this market can be attributed to the increasing number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases and the rise in awareness of rhythm-related conditions. Technological innovations, such as leadless pacemakers, which eliminate the need for wires to be inserted into the heart, have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their reduced risk of infection and improved comfort for patients. Furthermore, improvements in battery life, device size, and wireless connectivity have contributed to the growing demand for rhythm management devices. Remote monitoring capabilities have enabled healthcare providers to track patients' heart rhythms and adjust treatment protocols in real-time, offering a more personalized approach to patient care. As a result, rhythm management devices are expected to remain an important application segment, with the potential for continued growth as technology continues to evolve.</p> <h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2> <p>Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, has seen a significant improvement in treatment options due to implantable microelectronic medical devices. Deep brain stimulators (DBS) are the primary devices used to manage Parkinson’s disease, offering patients significant relief from symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. These devices work by delivering electrical pulses to targeted areas of the brain, helping to regulate abnormal neural activity. As the incidence of Parkinson's disease rises, particularly in older adults, the demand for DBS systems is expected to grow. The effectiveness of DBS in reducing symptoms and improving patients' quality of life has led to its widespread adoption, making it a key segment in the United States market for implantable microelectronic devices.
